<h2>CHARIVARIA</h2>.

  <p>The growing disposition to declare war against her is causing genuine
  concern in Germany, where it is feared that there may not be enough
  interned German vessels to go round.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>An Austrian General is reported to have been overwhelmed by an
  avalanche of snow, and at Easter-time a number of patriotic English
  people were offering, in view of the usefulness of the stuff for military
  purposes, to forgo their own ration.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The question of Parliamentary reform has been under discussion in the
  House of Commons. That the Legislature should attempt to deal with
  reforms of any kind which have not been previously demanded by the Daily
  Press is regarded in certain quarters as a most dangerous precedent.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Immediately north of the Siegfried line, the experts explain, is a new
  German position, which they have christened the Wotan line. It will not
  be long before we hear of fresh German activities in the Götterdämmerung
  line.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Thousands of men at the docks are boycotting public-houses as a
  protest against increased prices. A deputation of licensed victuallers
  will shortly wait upon the Government to inform them that their action in
  restricting the brewers' output is likely to have the deplorable effect
  of making drinking unpopular.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>There has been some slight activity on the Dublin front, but beyond a
  few skirmishes there is little to report.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>One of the most recent additions to the Entente Alliance proves that
  the art of war as practised by Germany is such a horrible travesty that
  even the Cubists condemn it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Goat-skin coats are mentioned by a lady writer as quite a novelty. She
  is in error. Goats have worn them for years.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A wedding at Huntingdon, the other day, was interrupted by the barking
  of dog within the vicinity of the church. It is a peculiar thing, but
  dogs have never looked upon marriage as the serious thing it really
  is.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We are sorry to contradict a contemporary, but the assertion that men
  are losing their chivalry cannot be lightly passed over. Only the other
  night in the tube a man was distinctly heard to say to a lady who was
  standing, "Pray accept my seat, Madam. I am getting out here."</p>

    <p><i>Small Invalid</i> (<i>to visitor</i>). "I'VE HAD A LOT OF
    DISEASES IN MY TIME &mdash; MEASLES &mdash; WHOOPING-COUGH &mdash;
    INFLUENZA &mdash; TONSILITIS &mdash; BUT (<i>modestly</i>) I HAVEN'T
    HAD DROPSY YET."</p>
  </div>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. DUKE has just stated that there is work for all in Ireland. This
  is not the way to make the Government popular in the distressed isle.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Vienna <i>Zeit</i> says the worst enemy of the people is their
  appetite. Several local humourists have been severely dealt with for
  pointing out that eating is the best way of getting rid of this pest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Stepney market porter attempted last week to evade military service
  by hiding in a cupboard, but the police captured him despite the fact
  that he attempted to throw them off the scent by making a noise like a
  piece of cheese&mdash;a very old device.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>On one day of Eastertide there was an inch of snow in Liverpool,
  followed by hailstones, lightning, thunder and a gale of wind. Summer has
  certainly arrived very early this year.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The <i>Berliner Tageblatt </i>makes much of the fact that a recent
  submarine expedition was carried out by means of German Naval officers on
  board a trawler "disguised as ordinary men." A clever piece of
  masquerading.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Members of the Honor Oak Golf Club," says a contemporary, "are
  arranging to play their rounds to the music of grunting pigs, cackling
  fowls and bleating lambs." With a little practice these intelligent
  animals should soon be able to convey their appreciation of the more
  elementary strokes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>WOLF'S comet is approaching the earth at the rate of 1,250,000 miles a
  day, and our special constables have been warned.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>England, said Lord LEICESTER recently, is neglecting her trees during
  the War. But with our Great Tree (Sir BEERBOHM) it is the other way
  about.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The overseer of one of the workhouses in the vicinity of London is to
  receive an additional four pounds a year in place of beer. It is hoped
  that this sum will buy him a nice glass of stout for his next Christmas
  dinner.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In justice to the thieves who removed 1½ cwt. of sugar from a grocer's
  shop in Kentish Town it should be stated that had it not been for an
  untimely alarm it was their intention to have taken a sufficient quantity
  of other articles to justify their appropriation of that amount of
  sugar.</p>

  <blockquote>"Only the older generation recalls the glass of sherry and
  slice of Madeira that used to be the invariable refreshment offered in
  the farmhouses of the Southwest."&mdash;<i>Daily
  Telegraph.</i></blockquote>

  <p>Our own recollection is that it was sometimes a glass of Madeira and a
  hunk of sherry.</p>

<h2>A SCHOOL FOR STATESMEN.</h2>

  <blockquote>[The <i>Hamburger Fremdenblatt</i>, in an article on our
  Ambassador at Petrograd, ascribes his success as a diplomat to his
  passion for golf&mdash;"if one can speak of passion in connection with
  this cold game of meadow billiards." "The conditions," it goes on to say,
  "in which this rather tiresome game is played do really produce the
  qualities necessary for any statesmanlike or diplomatic work.... Silent,
  tough, resigned, unbroken ... the good golfer walks round his field,
  keeps his eye on the ball and steers for his goal.... Sir George Buchanan
  walked round the whole golf field of Europe for years until at last he
  was able in Petrograd to hurl the ball into the goal."]</blockquote>

<h2>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>(The GERMAN CROWN PRINCE and Marshal HINDENBURG).</i></p>

  <p><i>Hindenburg.</i> So your Royal Highness proposes to leave us
  again?</p>

  <p><i>The Prince.</i>Yes, Marshal, I'm going to leave you for a short
  time. I have made arrangements which will render my absence from the
  Front as little disadvantageous as may be possible. My orders have been
  carefully drawn up so as to provide for every contingency, and I trust
  that nothing the enemy can do will find my stout fellows unprepared,
  while I am devising fresh triumphs for them in my temporary
  retirement.</p>

  <p><i>Hindenburg.</i> We shall all regret the absence of your Royal
  Highness from those fields in which you have planted new proofs both of
  German courage and of German intellectual superiority; but no doubt your
  Highness will be all the better for a short rest. May I, perhaps, ask the
  immediate cause of your Highness's departure from the Front?</p>

  <p><i>The Prince.</i> No, Marshal, you mustn't, for if you do I shall not
  answer you fully. <i>(Hums) Souvent femme varie; fol qui s'y
  fie</i>&mdash;do you know what that means, you rogue?</p>

  <p><i>Hindenburg.</i> I know your Highness spoke in French, which is not
  what I should have expected from one who stands so near to the
  throne.</p>

  <p><i>The Prince.</i> Now, you mustn't be angry; only dull people ever
  get angry.</p>

  <p><i>Hindenburg.</i> Your Royal Highness means to say&mdash;?</p>

  <p><i>The Prince.</i> I mean to say that you're not dull&mdash;not
  <i>really</i> dull, you know, and that therefore you can't be allowed to
  get angry about a mere trifle. Besides, our predecessor, the GREAT
  FREDERICK, always spoke in French and wrote his poetry in
  French&mdash;very poor stuff it was too&mdash;and had a violent contempt
  for the German language, which he considered a barbarous jargon.</p>

  <p><i>Hindenburg.</i> I care not what the GREAT FREDERICK may have
  thought as to this matter&mdash;there are other points in which it might
  be well to imitate him first rather than to remember what he thought and
  said about our noble German language&mdash;but for me it is enough to
  know that the Emperor and King whom I serve holds no such ideas.</p>

  <p><i>The Prince. </i>Of course he doesn't; he holds no ideas at all of
  any kind.</p>

  <p><i>Hindenburg.</i> At least he would be angry to hear such&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>The Prince. </i>Of course he would; he's dull enough in all
  conscience for that or anything else.</p>

  <p><i>Hindenburg (after a pause). </i>Your Royal Highness will, perhaps,
  forgive me if I draw your gracious attention to the fact that I have much
  work to do and but little time to do it in.</p>

  <p><i>The Prince.</i> Of course, my dear Marshal, of course. They're
  making things warm for you, aren't they, in the direction of Arras? I was
  saying to myself only this morning, "How annoying for that poor old
  HINDENBURG to have his masterly retreat interrupted by those atrocious
  English, and to lose thirteen thousand prisoners and one
  hundred-and-sixty guns, and I don't know how many killed and wounded.
  Where's his wall of steel now, poor old fellow, and his patent plan for
  luring the enemy on?" That's what I said to myself, and now that we have
  met I feel that I must offer you my condolences. I know what it is,
  though of course it wasn't <i>my</i> fault that we failed to bring it off
  against the French at Verdun. Heigho! I'm really beginning to believe
  that I shall never see Paris.</p>

  <p><i>Hindenburg.</i> &nbsp; !!! &nbsp; &nbsp; !!! &nbsp; &nbsp; !!!</p>

  <p><i>The Prince.</i> You needn't look so stuffy, dear old thing. I'm
  going. But remember <i>I</i> shall be your Emperor some day; and then
  what shall I do with you? I know; I shall have you taught French.</p>

      <p>Sergt.-Instructor George Bellairs</p>
      <p>Prided himself on dreadful swears,</p>
      <p>And half the night and all the day</p>
      <p>He thought of frightful things to say.</p>
      <p>On his recruits in serried squad</p>

<h3>A RATIONAL QUESTION.</h3>

  <p>Dear Mr. Punch,&mdash;Seeing from your cartoon that you have views of
  your own on Food Control, may I put a puzzling case to you? The other
  evening, after the theatre, I wished to give some supper to a hungry
  young soldier friend who any day now may be summoned to France. It was a
  quarter past eleven and I led him to a restaurant near Piccadilly Circus
  which was still open and busy. But the door-keeper refused to admit him.
  I might go in&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;but not a soldier. Now I am an elderly
  civilian, doing very little for my country except carrying on my own
  business and paying my way and my taxes; but this boy is a fighter,
  prepared to die for England if need be. Yet it is I who am allowed to eat
  at night, and not he, however much in need of food he may be! Surely
  there is some want of logic here?</p>

<h3>FIRST LINES.</h3>

  <p>After having spent an hour or so with WORDSWORTH'S sonnets I found my
  head so full of his sonorous adjuratory music that when in the middle of
  the night I woke as usual&mdash;from three to four is the worst
  time&mdash;my wooing of reluctant sleep took on a new fashion, and
  instead of repeating verses I made them. But I only once proceeded
  farther than the first line. Anybody who finds pleasure in poetic pains
  may add the other thirteen; to me such a task would savour of bad luck.

<h3>WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE.</h3>

<p class="center">PART I.</p>

  <p>Angelo Armstrong was a man of thirty. He had no capital, but by dint
  of honest and meritorious toil he found himself eventually earning a
  moderate salary as clerk in a London Insurance Office. He had been
  rejected for the Army on account of a defective knee-cap. Outside his
  work his tastes lay in the direction of botany and bibliomancy, which
  latter, according to the dictionary, is "Divination performed by
  selecting passages of Scripture at hazard." He also indulged in good
  works and was President of the Society for the Preservation of the
  Spiritual Welfare of the Deputy Harbour Masters at our English Seaports.
  Thus he was worthy of the name of Angelo by which his mother had insisted
  that he should be christened, after seeing a picture of the famous
  historical incident of "<i>Non Angli sed Angeli</i>."</p>

  <p>Strangely enough he had never yet come under the influence of love.
  The three diversions given above had filled his spare hours, and woman
  was to him a sealed book. One morning he found a letter on his
  breakfast-table from an old family friend; it read as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>Ton Répos," Woking</i>,</p>
      <p><i>December 11th, 1916</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"DEAR MR. ARMSTRONG,&mdash;Do tear yourself away from grimy London and
  come and spend the Christmas holidays with us. Only a small party and one
  of War-workers. We are all workers nowadays, aren't we? You <i>must</i>
  come!</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
      <p>AUGUSTA POGSON-DELABERE.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>N.B.&mdash;Our house is a long way from the Crematorium!</p>

  <p>This settled it; he decided to go.</p>

<p class="center">PART II.</p>

  <p>The Pogson-Delaberes' party at "Ton Répos" consisted of four guests:
  Col. Maxton, from Aldershot, commanding the 106th Battalion of the
  Drumlie Highlanders; Miss Agatha Simson, a middle-aged munition-worker;
  our hero, and, oh! the lovely Miss Sylvia Taunton, another War-worker,
  aged 22. The result may be easily guessed. For two days the young people
  were left, naturally, very much together. They quickly fell into an easy
  intimacy, and on the third and last day of the holiday Angelo was
  profoundly in love. Gone were the botanizers, gone the bibliomants, gone
  the Deputy Harbour Masters. There was but one thought in his evacuated
  brain, to make the fair Sylvia his own.</p>

  <p>His opportunity came after dinner that night when the rest of the
  party had gone out to look at some condemned pheasants which were to be
  shot at dawn. She was at the piano playing that deservedly popular song,
  "I've chipped my chip for England," by Nathaniel Dayer, when he suddenly
  leant over her. "Miss Taunton&mdash;Sylvia," he ejaculated, "you will be
  surprised at this suddenness, I know, but I cannot keep it in any longer;
  I love you enormously. Is there any chance for me?"</p>

  <p>She had just reached that passage in Nathaniel's song where a
  triumphant ascending scale in G rings out. She faltered and played D-flat
  instead of D-natural, the first dissonance that night&mdash;would it had
  been the last! Quickly she turned on the music-stool and on him, and
  spoke with averted head.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Armstrong, I will own frankly that I like you more than a little.
  Though we only met three days ago I am more drawn to you than I have ever
  been to any other man."</p>

  <p>"Aha," he cried exultingly.</p>

  <p>"But," she said, "I must say something about myself. While I am a
  War-worker, I have never told you yet what I am doing. I am a clerk in
  Marr's Bank, in Cheapside."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing dishonourable in that," he almost shouted.</p>

  <p>"There is not," she answered, haughtily drawing herself up.</p>

  <p>"I keep my account there," he said.</p>

  <p>"I know," she replied; "I am in the Pass-book department."</p>

  <p>He stood quite still, but the lapels of his dinner-jacket shook
  slightly.</p>

  <p>"My duties," she went on quietly, "are to report each evening to my
  chief, Mr. Hassets, on our clients' balances. Yours has never been higher
  than £24 7<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> during the eighteen months that I have
  been there. I am very sorry, but I cannot marry you."</p>

  <p>He looked straight into her inscrutable eyes and the right repartee
  froze on his lips.</p>

  <p>On the morrow he left at dawn, just as the birds were beginning to
  drop; and before the day was over he had transferred his account from
  Marr's Bank to Parr's.</p>

<h3>"IT."</h3>

<p class="center">PHASE I.</p>

  <p>The doctor says, perfectly cheerfully and as though it were really not
  a matter of vital importance, that there is no doubt that I have got IT.
  He remarks that IT is all over the place, and that he has a couple of
  hundred other cases at the present time.</p>

  <p>I resent his attitude as far as I have strength to do anything at all.
  I did not give permission for him to be called in just to have my
  sufferings brushed aside like this. He only stays about three minutes
  altogether, during which time he relates two funny stories (at least I
  suppose they are funny, because my nurse laughs; I can't see any point in
  them myself), and makes several futile remarks about the War. As though
  the War were a matter of importance by comparison! Then he goes, talking
  breezily all the way down the stairs.</p>

  <p>Well, I think darkly, they will be sorry presently. I have no
  intention <span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg
  255]</span> or expectation of getting better, and when they see me a fair
  young corpse then they'll know.</p>

  <p>Already I loathe the Two Hundred. Not that I believe for a minute the
  story of my own disease being the same as their miserable little
  complaints. In recurring periods of conscious thought I go through the
  list of things I know for a fact I have got&mdash;rheumatic fever,
  sciatica, lumbago, toothache, neuritis, bronchitis, laryngitis,
  tonsilitis, neuralgia, gastritis, catarrh of several kinds, heart disease
  and inflammation (or possibly congestion) of the lungs. I shall think of
  some more presently, if my nurse will let me alone and not keep on
  worrying me with her "Just drink this." Bother the woman! Why doesn't she
  get off the earth? What's the use of my swallowing that man's filthy
  medicine when he doesn't know what's the matter with me?</p>

  <p>I hate everybody and everything, especially the eider-down quilt,
  which rises in slow billows in front of my eyes and threatens to engulf
  me. When in a paroxysm of fury I suddenly cast it on the floor, it lies
  there still billowing, and seems to leer at me. There is something fat
  and sinister and German about that eiderdown. I never noticed it before.
  <i>Two Hundred German eider-downs!</i></p>

  <p>The firelight flickers weirdly about the room and I try to count the
  shadows. But before I begin I know the answer&mdash;TWO HUNDRED.</p>

  <p>I drift into a nightmare of Two Hundred elusive cabbages which I am
  endeavouring to plant in my new allotment, where a harsh fate forces me
  to dig and <i>dig</i> and DIG, and, as a natural consequence, also to
  ache and <i>ache</i> and ACHE.</p>

<p class="center">PHASE II.</p>

  <p>I can stand up with assistance from the bed-post and totter feebly to
  an arm-chair by the fire, where I sit in a dressing-gown and weep. What
  for? I couldn't say, except that it seems a fit and proper thing to
  do.</p>

  <p>I am still of opinion that I am not long for this world, and my
  favourite occupation at present is counting up the number of wreaths that
  I might justifiably expect to have sent to my funeral. I don't tell my
  nurse, who would immediately try to "cheer me up" by talking to me or
  giving me a magazine to look at. And I would <i>much</i> rather count
  wreaths. The Smiths probably would not be able to afford one....</p>

  <p>My thoughts are distracted by the sudden apparition of a little meal.
  I begin to take an interest in these little meals, which are of such
  frequent occurrence that I am reduced to tears again, this time at the
  thought of the extra expense I am causing. And all for nothing. Why don't
  they save the money for wreaths?</p>

  <p>The doctor comes while I am swallowing my egg, miserably yet with a
  certain gusto, and I dry my eyes hastily as I hear him bounding up the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"Hullo," he calls out before he is well through the door, "how are we
  to-day, eh? Beginning to sit up and take notice? I think we'll change
  your medicine."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> think," I remark resignedly, "that it will be best for
  someone to dig a hole and bury me."</p>

  <p>"Jolly good idea," he agrees heartily. "In fact why not do it to all
  of us? Please the Germans so too. But it can't be done, you
  know&mdash;there's a shortage of grave-diggers."</p>

  <p>Heartless brute!</p>

<h3>THE HINDENBURG LINE.</h3>

  <p>In our earnest endeavour to discover exactly where this impregnable
  barrier is likely to be encountered we have collected the following
  references to it in the German Press of the next few months:&mdash;</p>

  <p>... Our troops, according to plan, are now operating to the east of
  the Vimy Ridge where the fighting is taking the direction intended by us.
  We have succeeded in restoring a condition of voluntary elasticity,
  preparatory to the occupation of the famous Hindenburg Line, which covers
  Douai, St. Quentin and La Fère.</p>

  <p>... Our rearguard actions to the east of St. Quentin are developing in
  accordance with our wildest dreams, our troops, after their brief respite
  in the so-called Wotan Line, displaying their ability in a war of rapid
  movement. The hesitating British are disconcerted by the recrudescence of
  fluidity on the front. We learn with satisfaction that our Northern
  divisions are now safely established in the Hindenburg Line&mdash;to the
  east of Douai.</p>

  <p>... We learn to-day with the very keenest emotion of the complete and
  brilliant evacuation of the Siegfried Line, to the east of Douai, and the
  re-establishment of a new measure of liquidity. British aeroplanes (of
  which 133 have been brought down according to plan) have been making long
  flights over our territory with a view to observation of the Hindenburg
  Line&mdash;on the left bank of the Meuse. It is said that two of our
  machines are missing, but a recount has been ordered. There must be some
  mistake.</p>

  <p>... A shrewd blow has been dealt to the British by our abandonment, in
  agreement with the prospectus, of the Beckmesser Line. All has gone
  according to our hopes, our longings and our prayers. We have crossed the
  Meuse.</p>

  <p>... The secret is out at last. The Hindenburg Line, about which there
  has been so much speculation, is now known to run through Liége,
  Luxemburg and Metz. According to schedule we are now approaching this
  position, which has only been attained by an amazing display of
  spontaneous volatility on our part. The fighting of the last few weeks,
  in the neighbourhood of the Pogner, Sieglinda, Kurvenal and Lohengrin
  Lines, fell out as had been prognosticated by us.</p>

  <p>... The importance of Cologne, as the main bastion of the impregnable
  Hindenburg Line, cannot be over-rated. Our strategical, voluntary and
  gratuitous crossing of the Rhine was carried out according to
  <i>agenda</i>....</p>

      <p>"I was a General," I said.</p>
      <p>"Come, and I'll tell you something more</p>
      <p>Of what I did in the Great War."</p>
      <p>At once the wonder-waiting eyes</p>
      <p>Were opened in a mild surmise;</p>
      <p>Smiling, I helped the little man</p>
      <p>To mount my knee, and so began:</p>
      <p>"When first the War broke out, you see,</p>
      <p>Grandma became a V.A.D.;</p>
      <p>Your Aunties spent laborious days</p>
      <p>In working at Y.M.C.A.'s;</p>
      <p>The servants vanished. Cook was found</p>
      <p>Doing the conscript baker's round;</p>
      <p>The housemaid, Jane, in shortened skirt</p>
      <p>(She always was a brazen flirt),</p>
      <p>Forsook her dusters, brooms and pails</p>
      <p>To carry on with endless mails.</p>
      <p>The parlourmaid became a vet.,</p>
      <p>The tweeny a conductorette,</p>
      <p>And both the others found their missions</p>
      <p>In manufacturing munitions.</p>
      <p>I was a City man. I knew</p>
      <p>No useful trade. What could I do?</p>
      <p>Your Granddad, boy, was not the sort</p>
      <p>To yield to fate; he was a sport.</p>
      <p>I set to work; I rose at six,</p>
      <p>Summer and winter; chopped the sticks,</p>
      <p>Kindled the fire, made early tea</p>
      <p>For Aunties and the V.A.D.</p>
      <p>I cooked the porridge, eggs and ham,</p>
      <p>Set out the marmalade and jam,</p>
      <p>And packed the workers off, well fed,</p>
      <p>Well warmed, well brushed, well valeted.</p>
      <p>I spent the morning in a rush</p>
      <p>With dustpan, pail and scrubbing-brush;</p>
      <p>Then with a string-bag sallied out</p>
      <p>To net the cabbage or the sprout,</p>
      <p>Or in the neighbouring butcher's shop</p>
      <p>Select the juiciest steak or chop.</p>
      <p>So when the sun had sought the West,</p>
      <p>And brought my toilers home to rest,</p>
      <p>Savours more sweet than scent of roses</p>
      <p>Greeted their eager-sniffing noses&mdash;</p>
      <p>Savours of dishes most divine</p>
      <p>Prepared and cooked by skill of mine.</p>
      <p>I was a General. Now you know</p>
      <p>How Generals helped to down the foe."</p>
      <p>The little chap slipped off my knee</p>
      <p>And gazed in solemn awe at me,</p>
      <p>Stood at attention, stiff and mute,</p>
      <p>And gave his very best salute.</p>

    <h3>THE RECRUIT'S FAREWELL TO HIS BOWLER.</h3>
  </div>
<hr />

<h2>JOLLYMOUSE</h2>.

  <p>In what I will particularise as the &mdash;&mdash; area of the War
  zone, there is a small village-by-a-stream where Generals stride about
  the narrow streets or whirl through them in gigantic cars, and guards at
  every corner clank and turn out umpty times a day. Down in the hollow the
  stream by the village laughs placidly along, mocking at the Great War,
  but I doubt if the Generals have much time to listen to it, for the
  village-by-the-stream is a Corps Headquarters.</p>

  <p>However the Doctor led us (which includes the War Babe and James the
  Acting Adjutant) to the village-by-the-stream, where, just across the
  stone bridge, he indicated on the wall of a house the legend:</p>

<p class="center">RESTAURANT FOR OFFICERS.</p>

<p class="center">TEA, COFFEE, CHAMPAGNE AND ALL SUCH ARTICLE IS SELL HERE.</p>

  <p>"Tea," he said feelingly, "and there will be china cups and thin
  bread-and-butter, and real milk and come along in."</p>

  <p>It was rather a composite restaurant. There was a glassed-in balcony
  with tables and chairs; and all around there were puttees, handkerchiefs,
  paper-weights, inkstands, wrist-watches and electric torches. There were
  loose-leaved pocket diaries of abominable ingenuity (irresistible to
  Adjutants); collars and ties to clothe the neck of man, and soap to wash
  it withal. Hair lotions, safety-razors, <i>pâté de foie gras</i>, sponges
  and writing-pads jostled each other on the shelves. Walking-sticks and
  bottles of champagne lay in profusion on the floor. It was less of a
  restaurant than an emporium, but the Doctor sat down contentedly and rang
  the bell; and the War Babe threw out battle patrols to reconnoitre the
  position.</p>

  <p>He passed unscathed through the barrage of sticks and diaries; evaded
  skilfully the indirect fire of electric torches; reached his first
  objective among the soap-boxes, and there met his fate.</p>

  <p>"Doctor," he demanded suddenly, "what's 'savon jollymouse'?"</p>

  <p>"Savon," the doctor began didactically, "is a preparation of fatty
  acids saponified with alkali. It is principally manufactured from
  coker-nut oil, although other similar, if less offensive, substances are
  sometimes employed. In the English tongue it is known as 'soap,'
  and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You idiot," said the War Babe amiably, "I know what 'savon' is. But
  what's a 'jollymouse'?"</p>

  <p>"A rodent," replied the Doctor&mdash;"a small rodent in a state of
  mental exhilaration or merriment."</p>

  <p>"Rats."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the same definition would also apply to rats. <i>Jolly</i> rats,
  that is to say."</p>

  <p>"You're very bright to-day, Doctor," said the War Babe, "but it
  doesn't happen to be that kind of mouse at all. It's j-o-l-i, jolly;
  m-o-u-s-s-e&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say that before? That's quite different. It's
  pronounced moose&mdash;zholimoose."</p>

  <p>The War Babe sniffed.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you know what it means any more than I do."</p>

  <p>"Son of Mars," the Doctor answered gravely, "you are measuring my
  ignorance by your own&mdash;a great mistake. As a matter of fact that
  word is put on the packet simply to deceive unwary Babes. It has nothing
  whatever to do with soap."</p>

  <p>"Well, since you know so much," said the War Babe, closing with his
  opponent, "what <i>is</i> a jollymouse or whatever you call it?"</p>

  <p>"A zholimoose, my dear," the Doctor began, "is very hard to describe
  and has to be seen to be believed. A War Babe would probably not
  recognise one if he saw it. To give you a rough idea, however, it is an
  airy Will-o'-the-wispish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The bell had done its work at last, and there suddenly entered by an
  inner door a fair-haired, fair-skinned French girl almost too pretty to
  be real. The Doctor paused with his eyes on her and then his face lit up
  with triumph.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, in a low vibrating tone, "behold the zholimoose.
  Hush. It will probably come closer if you don't frighten it."</p>

  <p>"Have you got the landing-net?" whispered James hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Yes. And the killing bottle. It's <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span> this War Babe I'm afraid
  of. He's sure to scare it. Don't glare at her like that, War Babe.
  Pretend you're a soap-box."</p>

  <p>She hovered on the threshold. It seemed touch and go... and then the
  War Babe broke the ice in his choicest French.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle!"</p>

  <p>"Messieurs!" She came daintily forward and looked inquiries at us
  all.</p>

  <p>"Tay avec&mdash;er bread-and-butter, si-vooplay," the Doctor ground
  out in his execrable lingo. "And&mdash;er&mdash;I never can remember the
  French for milk."</p>

  <p>"Lait?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's it. Now, Mademoiselle-lay. But not canned stuff. Vray
  lay."</p>

  <p>Her eyes grew wider and wider at this strange jargon.</p>

  <p>"Comment, M'sieur?"</p>

  <p>"Vray lay."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you mean lait an naturel," growled James.</p>

  <p>"Du lait frais," I hazarded.</p>

  <p>"Ah. Comprends. C'est triste. Pas de lait frais. Les hôpitaux prennent
  tout."</p>

  <p>"No milk?" wailed the Doctor. He looked fixedly at the table and one
  saw from the movement of his lips that he was mustering his forces for
  another plunge into the language. Meanwhile the War Babe, whose eyes had
  not left the girl's face, ventured again on the thin ice of speech.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he began hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Oui, M'sieur." She turned to him, the picture of rapt attention.</p>

  <p>"Où est la jollymouse&mdash;moose, I mean?"</p>

  <p>She looked from one to another of us in perplexity.</p>

  <p>"Qu'est ce qu'il veut dire?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Il veut voir la jolimousse," we explained, and the War Babe held out
  the soap-box, pointing with expressive pantomime to the words on it. Her
  eyes twinkled appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"Nous&mdash;nous supposerons que&mdash;vous êtes&mdash;la jolimouse,"
  said the War Babe slowly, choosing his words with care.</p>

  <p>"Bien sûr," James added affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"Moi?" She rippled with laughter. "Oh non. Attendez, Messieurs. Ouait
  one mineet." She flitted through the door like some beautiful butterfly,
  and in a moment returned with the smallest, softest, warmest lump of
  blue-grey fur nestling against her. It was a tiny blue Persian
  kitten.</p>

  <p>"Voilà!" she said, caressing it tenderly, "la jolimousse." She handed
  it gravely to the War Babe, who received it with almost reverend
  care.</p>

  <p>It seems perhaps a little worldly to return to the subject of tea, but
  doctors are worldly creatures. However, at this point the doom of the
  gods descended, for there was no tea to be obtained, only coffee; no
  bread-and-butter, only little hard biscuits; and the cups, though
  certainly china, were but little larger than liqueur-glasses. But one of
  us at least was impervious to disappointments. The War Babe sat silently,
  with the kitten in his lap, like a seer of visions, until, just as we
  were about to leave, an impulse suddenly galvanized him. "I'll pay," he
  said, and marched into the inner room....</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Meanly.</i> Good. I will write a letter. And then the day after

<h3>A CURRENT EVENT.</h3>

  <p>Years ago Mr. Punch, in a moment of inspiration (I wrote the article
  myself), suggested that some benevolent American millionaire might alter
  the course of the Gulf Stream so that it flowed right round these
  islands. In the eye of imagination he saw date palms bordering the
  Strand, costers sitting under their own banana trees, and stately
  cavalcades of camels bearing wearied City men to Balham or Putney.
  (Unhappily he could not look so far into the future as to forecast the
  allotment holders returning home laden with sugar-canes).</p>

  <p>Now a writer in <i>The Times</i> suggests that the chill of the
  present season is due to the effect of the Panama Canal on the Gulf
  Stream. This is an insidious attempt to make bad blood between ourselves
  and our new allies. We could only feel the bitterest hostility towards
  anyone in any way responsible for the present season. Why, this spring
  has spread such devastation through the land that writers of nature notes
  have been unable to pay their plumbers' bills.</p>

  <p>But while we repudiate the implication of American responsibility we
  think it well to be absolutely on the safe side; so we suggest that it
  would be a friendly act, and consonant with the new spirit of alliance,
  if she would kindly keep the Panama Canal plugged for the next few weeks.
  One would like to make sure of hearing the cuckoo in Victory Year.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"THE OLD LADY SHOWS HER MEDALS."</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. Dowey</i> (actually a virgin spinster), felt herself out of it
  because she had no son at the Front to talk about. I gathered that it was
  not so much a case of unsatisfied yearning for motherhood, as that she
  wanted to hold her own with the other charwomen who were represented in
  the trenches. So she assumed the relationship of an anonymous
  <i>marraine</i> towards a certain unknown namesake in the Black Watch,
  and made boastful pretence of having received letters from her son.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she is confronted with this <i>Private Dowey</i>, home on
  leave&mdash;a lonely soldier with no family ties. The joy that she had
  taken in her imagined sense of proprietorship is dashed by fear of
  exposure and of possible resentment on his part. At first he treats her
  intrusion almost brutally, but is soon mollified by the offer of food and
  other hospitality; and by the time his leave is up he has developed an
  almost filial regard for her. Their parting is as the parting of a
  tender-hearted mother and a rather unemotional son. The pathos of this
  scene, though designed and interpreted with a very sensitive restraint,
  was comparatively obvious&mdash;a commonplace, indeed, of these
  heart-rending days. There was a far more subtle and original note of
  pathos in the contrast between the brusque humour of the man's casual
  acceptance of the situation and the timorous, adoring, dog-like devotion
  of the woman. Here tears and laughter were never far apart.</p>

  <p>I could wish that the impression left by this picture had not been a
  little spoiled by the final scene, in which she lingers lovingly over the
  medals and uniform of the dead soldier. No good purpose, dramatic or
  other, was served by this gratuitous appendage to a finished work of
  art.</p>

  <p>Miss JEAN CADELL was simply wonderful; and Mr. MULCASTER, as
  <i>Private Dowey</i>, typically Scottish in his cautious reservations,
  was admirable. Mr. EDGAR WOOD played capably as one of our many eligible
  but non-combatant clergymen; and the chorus of aggressively humorous
  charwomen, though perhaps they had rather too much to say, said it very
  well.</p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"SEVEN WOMEN" AND ONE SAILOR.</p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Leonora</i> ... Miss IRENE VANBRUGH.</p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Captain Rattray, R.N</i> ... MR. GORDON ASH.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Sir JAMES BARRIE'S other one-Act play, <i>Seven Women</i> (all rolled
  into one), suffered, as might be expected, from compression.
  <i>Leonora</i> had to be a clinging motherly creature, a desperate flirt,
  a gifted humourist, a woman without humour, a murderess (out of an old
  play by the same author), and two other types which escape me. In the
  course of about a quarter of an hour she had to give a succinct
  <i>précis</i> of the different moods which her versatile personality
  might in actual life conceivably have assumed if she had had a month to
  do it in. Miss IRENE VANBRUGH, with her swift humour and her skill as a
  quick-change artist, naturally revelled in this <i>tour de force</i>,
  and, thanks to her, the author came very near to being justified of his
  caprice.</p>

  <p>Between these two plays was sandwiched Mr. A.A. MILNE'S</p>

<p class="center">"WURZEL-FLUMMERY."</p>

  <p>There was never any doubt about the freshness and spontaneity of Mr.
  MILNE'S humour. The only question was whether an author so fastidiously
  unstagey, who never underlines his intentions, would be able to
  accommodate himself to the conditions of a medium that discourages the
  elliptical method. Well, he did it, and very artfully. He began by making
  concessions to the habits of his new audience. He wouldn't try them too
  high at first. In the person of <i>Robert Crawshaw, M.P.</i> (Mr. NIGEL
  PLAYFAIR), he introduced them to a more or less conventional
  type&mdash;exposed, it is true, to a very unusual test of character but
  dealing with it as such a type was bound to deal. Then, having inspired
  confidence, he created a rarer atmosphere, and in <i>Denis Clifton</i>, a
  blend of solicitor and play-wright, he produced a figure of fantasy whose
  delightfully irresponsible humour might have found his audience a little
  shy at an earlier stage. There was a real note of distinction,
  extraordinarily well maintained, in <i>Clifton's</i> dialogue with
  <i>Crawshaw</i> and the boy-clerk, and Mr. MILNE was particularly
  fortunate to have the part interpreted by Mr. DION BOUCICAULT, who
  developed qualities <span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"
  id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span> undreamed of in my previous estimation
  of his gifts.</p>

  <p>When that inveterate cynic, <i>Anthony Clifton</i>, made a will (it is
  not Mr. MILNE'S fault that, since he wrote his play before going out to
  the Front, we have had two others turning on eccentric bequests) leaving
  £50,000 each to two perfect strangers on the condition that they adopted
  the preposterous name of Wurzel-Flummery, he hoped to have the grim
  satisfaction of witnessing, from the grave, an exhibition of human
  weakness. Of the two legatees&mdash;politicians on opposite sides of the
  House&mdash;<i>Crawshaw</i>, whose whiskers gave him the air of a
  successful grocer of the mid-Victorian period, found reasons sufficiently
  convincing to himself for accepting the testator's terms; while
  <i>Richard Meriton</i>, who had little besides his salary as an M.P.,
  took the high line of proper pride and declared his determination to
  refuse. Mr. MILNE, by the way, did not specify the respective politics of
  these two, but I judge, from my knowledge of his own, that
  <i>Crawshaw</i> was meant to be a Tory and <i>Meriton</i> a Liberal.</p>

  <p>The latter eventually succumbed to pressure on the part of
  <i>Crawshaw's</i> daughter, who cared nothing for names so long as she
  could marry the man of her choice&mdash;a prospect denied to her by her
  father, who thought little of poor men. Meanwhile <i>Meriton's</i> lofty
  attitude of general contempt for money, and particular contempt for it
  when offered on degrading terms, gave scope for a little serious
  relief.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">

      alt="The politician at home." /></a>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THE POLITICIAN AT HOME.</p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Robert Crawshaw, M.P</i> ... MR. NIGEL PLAYFAIR.</p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Mrs. Crawshaw</i> ... MISS HELEN HAYE.</p>
  </div>
  <p>There are, of course, more ways of viewing the question than could be
  compressed into so short a play. Myself, I confess to a sneaking sympathy
  with the standpoint of <i>Crawshaw</i>. Money for him did not mean mere
  self-indulgence; it meant outward show&mdash;a house in a better
  neighbourhood, a more expensive car, a higher status in the opinion of
  his world&mdash;all the things that somehow help in what is called a
  career. By accepting the fifty thousand pounds he would gain something in
  the public eye; by assuming the name of Wurzel-Flummery he would lose
  something. He weighed the two against one another, and concluded that he
  would gain more than he would lose. This argument furnished a good enough
  motive according to his lights.</p>

  <p><i>Meriton</i>, on the other hand, after professing to prefer a clean
  heart to filthy lucre, is persuaded by <i>Violet Crawshaw</i>, who argues
  that he would surely make any sacrifice to save her from starving, and
  she was starving for love. So he yields, saying, in effect, to Honour, "I
  love thee, dear; I love thee much; but I love <i>Violet</i> more."
  Incidentally he takes care to overlook the fact that he was not nobly
  suffering an indignity for the sake of a great cause&mdash;such, let us
  say, as the founding of a hospital&mdash;but that he himself stood to
  gain at least as much as the girl. I am almost afraid that <i>Meriton</i>
  was a bit of a hypocrite. Certainly, in view of his exalted standards, he
  came out of the business worse than <i>Crawshaw</i> did. Perhaps, after
  all, Mr. MILNE meant him to be a Tory.</p>

  <p>But I must not exploit the pleasant field of casuistry opened up by
  the author's theme, but content myself with complimenting him very
  heartily on his share of this triple bill, in which, at the first
  attempt, he held his own in the company of so experienced an artist as
  Sir JAMES BARRIE. I ought to add that he had an excellent cast, very
  quick to appreciate and reproduce the iridescent gaiety of his
  humour.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned, Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>The Life of Algernon Charles Swinburne</i> (MACMILLAN) is a book
  that may be regarded as filling, at least partially, what has long been
  an aching void in our biographical shelves. I say partially, because the
  time has not perhaps fully come for an unreserved appreciation of a
  character whose handling must present exceptional difficulties. One
  cannot but notice how many obstacles Mr. EDMUND GOSSE has had to
  overcome, or avoid, in the present volume. The result inevitably is a
  certain sense of over-discretion that makes the whole study so detached
  as to be at times lacking in vitality. Even, however, with these
  reservations the figure of the poet stands out, bewildering as it must
  have been in life, with its strange blend of frailty and genius. Stories
  abound also (sometimes one suspects Mr. GOSSE of having fallen back upon
  anecdote with an air of relief); they range from the early days of
  brilliant "failures" at Eton and Balliol to those when in the watchful
  security of Putney the lamp was guarded by hands so zealous that its
  flame was ultimately extinguished. Two of the tales remain pleasantly in
  my memory, one of them describing how young ALGERNON, lately sent down
  from Oxford and a pupil at the rectory of the future Bishop STUBBS,
  scared away his host's rustic congregation by leaning upon the
  garden-gate one Sunday morning, looking, with his red-gold hair and
  scarlet dressing-gown, like some "flaming apparition." The other, less
  picturesque but more credible, has also a bishop in it, and concerns an
  untimely recitation of <i>Les Noyades</i>. I will leave you to find this
  for yourself in a book that forms at least an interesting, if not
  altogether final, study of a fascinating subject.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>For an old hand BENJAMIN SWIFT shows a poor discretion in crowding too
  many characters into his pages to allow of anything like adequate
  characterisation, and indeed, in <i>What Lies Beneath</i> (CHAPMAN AND
  HALL), he is too much concerned with his main purpose of tract-making to
  be sufficiently interested in the subsidiary business of good
  story-telling. A <i>Mr. Ravendale</i>, an unpleasant, hoary-bearded
  patriarch and opulent seller of Bibles, who has buried three wives and
  lives in a fat Bloomsbury house with the collected offspring of his three
  marriages, and one or two step-children thrown in, is haunted by a doubt
  as to whether the beautiful <i>Ruby Delmore</i>, daughter of the widow
  <i>Delmore</i>, his second wife, is also the daughter of the late <i>Mr.
  Delmore</i> or of himself, whose attitude towards <i>Mrs. Delmore</i> had
  not been as correct as that of a seller of Bibles is reasonably expected
  to be, especially by people like the author who don't believe in Bibles.
  At any rate <i>Sebastian</i>, son by the first marriage, is desperately
  in love with <i>Ruby</i>&mdash;so, you see, the old man had something to
  worry about. However, it all turns out to be, in fact, mere illusion,
  developing into a fatal monomania, and the family business is left to be
  carried on by such of the next generation as have not been convinced by
  the formidable array of evidence, anti-Theistic and anti-Christian, of
  two of the characters (who, it is clear, have sedulously read the same
  books). <i>Sebastian</i> loses his faith apparently because he has been
  distressed by the sight of a wounded horse in the great War, as if it
  were necessary to wait for the great War for this kind of a difficulty! A
  certain rough earnestness lies beneath this rather crude presentment of a
  world-old problem. But I wonder how much of the honest patriotism which
  fills the book would survive a rationalism as perverse and shallow as Mr.
  SWIFT applies to traditional faiths. <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg 264]</span> Does he imagine they have
  no better defences than those which he puts into the weak mouth of silly
  <i>Mr. Teanby</i>, the parson?</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The arrangement of Lady POORE'S new volume of recollections, <i>An
  Admiral's Wife in the Making</i> (SMITH, ELDER), reminded me quaintly of
  certain romances familiar to my boyhood, in which the fortunes of the
  hero were traced from cadetship in aspiring sequence. Because, of course,
  this is exactly what happens to the hero of the present book; the chief
  difference being that he himself makes only a brief personal appearance
  therein (though the chapters in question, formed from letters and diaries
  of Commander POORE during the Nile Expedition of '85, are by no means the
  least interesting part of the volume). For the rest, one might perhaps
  call it a draught of Naval small beer, but a very sparkling beverage and
  served with a highly attractive head upon it. To drop metaphor, Lady
  POORE has brought together a most entertaining collection of breezy
  reminiscences of life ashore and on the ocean wave. There is matter to
  suit all tastes, from her recollections of economies in a furnished villa
  at Paramé, where chickens were to be bought for thirty-two sous, to more
  exalted anecdotes connected with the time when her hero had been advanced
  as far as the post of Commander of the Royal Yacht <i>Victoria and
  Albert</i>. It is all kindly gossip, not ill suited to the best-tempered
  service in the world. Especially did I like Lady POORE'S gently maternal
  attitude towards the many junior officers who figure very attractively in
  her pages (<i>e.g.</i> the jovial pic-nic party in the Blue Mountains,
  who slaked their thirst from the Government rain-gauge, and thereby
  disorganised the meteorological records of Jamaica). Certainly the book
  could not have appeared in times more apt to give it a hearty
  welcome.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Stars in their Courses</i> (UNWIN) is not, as you might
  possibly suppose, a work of theatrical history, but just the latest
  volume in that admirable series, the First Novel Library. While I am not
  claiming for it any startling pre-eminence, it is at least a story of
  more than ordinary promise, and one that easily contrived to hold my
  interest. This is, perhaps, the more odd, since Miss HILDA M. SHARP has
  apparently of deliberate intent called in every one of the three
  conventions that all good young novelists are bidden to avoid&mdash;the
  long-nourished revenge, the missing will, and the super-quixotic
  self-sacrifice. Naturally the last is the worst. Thus when old <i>Mr.
  Yardley</i> (who had, I fancy, more than a touch of the melodramatic
  habits of the late <i>Mr. Dombey</i>) planned to revenge himself upon a
  faithless wife by bringing up his and her son with extravagant tastes,
  and leaving him penniless, I winced but endured. When, repenting of such
  inhuman intentions, he revoked them by a will, carefully placed, for
  subsequent discovery, between the pages of a put-away book, I still held
  an undaunted course. But, when <i>Patrick</i>, the disinherited
  spendthrift, took upon himself, for the thinnest reason, all the blame of
  his supplanter's evil doing and kept up this idiotic fraud till the girl
  of his heart, and indeed everyone who cared for him, turned their backs
  in disdain, then I confess to having felt that Miss SHARP was trying my
  forbearance too high. But even so the fact that I could not throw the
  book down unfinished seems to show that whoever selects Mr. UNWIN'S
  <i>débutantes</i> has spotted another winner. If, in short, Miss SHARP
  will forget all the novels she may ever have read, and choose for her
  next story something a little nearer to life, I believe the result may be
  remarkable.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Nursing Adventures</i>, with its sub-title, <i>A F.A.N.Y. in
  France</i>, is a notable addition to the series of War-literature which
  is bringing grist to Messrs. HEINEMANN'S windmill. F.A.N.Y., in case it
  has you puzzled, means First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. Starting from one
  woman this corps now has over fifty members working in the zone of the
  armies, and I shall believe that no one can read of their efficiency and
  courage without genuine admiration. This is not an official account of
  the F.A.N.Y. Corps&mdash;that is to come when the Hun is beaten&mdash;but
  the author has told enough to convince us of the sound work that has been
  and is being done by these brave and gentle-hearted women. Fortunately
  she has the gift of selection, in spite of a rather breathless style,
  which however goes excellently well with a narrative full of excitement
  and danger. Here too once more a fine tribute is paid to the incorrigible
  courage of the Allies in face of an enemy that has forgotten the
  elementary rules of humanity.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Those who have sampled any reasonable selection of the eighty or so
  published works of "KATHARINE TYNAN" will know what pleasant fare to
  expect in <i>Kit</i> (SMITH, ELDER). <i>Kit</i> is a pretty, red-haired,
  peasant girl approved for her gentle ways and honest breeding by Madam of
  the big house, and sent, on the advice of one of Mrs. HINKSON'S nice,
  human, friendly priests, to a convent for the higher education. She stirs
  the sentimental soul of one of the English quality, <i>Captain Guy
  Dering</i>; is plunged into, and rather chilled by, high-life in the
  modern English manner, and eventually goes back to her own people and her
  girlhood's friend, <i>Donal Sheehy</i>, who returns from America a made
  man. 'Tis not a chronicle to set the Liffey afire, but it is wholesome,
  escapes being mawkish, and may be confidently recommended for an anxious
  old person to give to sensitive young persons&mdash;if there be still any
  such. Mrs. HINKSON, though she loves her own, is no blind partisan and
  does not spare her criticism. So that you get a plausible picture of a
  kindly decent native Irish folk of all sorts, not a little helpful in
  these days of stress and promise.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
